### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Omri Attal and I'm currently pursuing a Computer Science with Big Data bachelors degree from Ben-Gurion University of the Negev in Israel.

Working at [Valens](https://www.valens.com/) as an RT/embedded software engineer.

#### Other projects that I've worked on:
* âš¡ Testmaster - Developed a social platform for university students that helps them in exams preparation. Currently consisting of around 700 members and is growing every day. Link: www.test-master.org
* âš¡ Cryptocurrency trading bot - Built an autonomous bot as a part of a team. The bot buys and sells cryptocurrency according to its own strategies. This is a multi-threaded OOP Java program that uses Binanceâ€™s API. Link: https://github.com/yonathan95/BinanceTradingBot
* âš¡ Translating some Agent Models book chapters to Julia using Gen as a probablistic programming language - https://github.com/Roeezz/AgentModelsJulia
* âš¡ Peer 2 Peer program where each client shares its local operations made on a common string, and in the end all local strings converge. This is done using Lamport timestamp algorithm and a merge algorithm that uses timestamps.
